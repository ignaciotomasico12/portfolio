      "p1": "Hi, I'm Ignacio Tomás Floría, I'm a Frontend developer and I love creating and developing new and challenging projects that allow me to continue learning and growing as a professional. I started programming a few years ago, when I finished High School and decided to study a higher-level degree in Computer Networks. There, although it was little, I learned the basics of web programming with HTML and CSS. Since then, thanks to a colleague and good friend, who taught me almost everything I know about web programming, I have been specializing in various web programming languages.",

In these few years as a web developer, I have been able to learn and work with different web programming languages."
